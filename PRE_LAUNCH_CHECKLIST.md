# Pre-Launch Checklist for Norwegian Booking Platform

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Improvements (Today)

### 1. JWT Secret Validation ‚úÖ
- **File**: `lib/auth/jwt.ts`
- **What**: Added validation to prevent app from running in production without proper JWT_SECRET
- **Action Required**: Set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable before deployment
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

### 2. Stripe Webhook Handler ‚úÖ
- **File**: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- **What**: Created webhook endpoint to handle payment confirmations
- **Features**:
  - Verifies webhook signatures for security
  - Handles `payment_intent.succeeded` - confirms booking and sends email
  - Handles `payment_intent.payment_failed` - cancels booking
  - Handles `payment_intent.canceled` - cancels booking
- **Action Required**:
  1. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in environment variables
  2. Configure webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
  3. Subscribe to events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`

### 3. Security Headers & CORS ‚úÖ
- **File**: `middleware.ts`
- **What**: Added security headers to all responses
- **Features**:
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevents clickjacking)
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - CORS for public booking endpoints
- **Action Required**: Update `allowedOrigins` in middleware.ts with your production domains

### 4. Rate Limiting ‚úÖ
- **File**: `lib/utils/rate-limit.ts`
- **What**: In-memory rate limiting for auth endpoints
- **Applied to**:
  - `/api/auth/login` - 5 requests per 15 minutes
  - `/api/auth/register` - 5 requests per 15 minutes
- **Future**: Consider using Redis for production (current implementation works but loses state on restart)

## üö® CRITICAL: Must Complete Before Launch

### 1. Environment Variables
**File**: `.env`

```bash
# CRITICAL - Generate strong secrets
JWT_SECRET="[GENERATE 64+ CHARACTER RANDOM STRING]"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="[GENERATE 64+ CHARACTER RANDOM STRING]"

# Stripe Production Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..."
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..." # Get from Stripe Dashboard

# SendGrid (for emails)
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG...."
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME="Your Business Name"

# Database (Supabase Production)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Application URLs
APP_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
NODE_ENV="production"
```

**How to generate secrets**:
```bash
# On Mac/Linux:
openssl rand -base64 64

# Or use Node.js:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('base64'))"
```

### 2. Database Migration
```bash
# Run migrations on production database
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Stripe Configuration
1. Switch from test mode to live mode in Stripe Dashboard
2. Update API keys in `.env`
3. Configure webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Subscribe to events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`
5. Copy webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 4. SendGrid Configuration
1. Verify sender email address in SendGrid
2. Add SPF, DKIM records to your domain DNS
3. Test email delivery: `npm run test:email` (create this script)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Should Complete Before Launch

### 1. Payment Testing
- [ ] Test Stripe payment flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test Vipps payment flow (if implementing)
- [ ] Verify webhook receives and processes events correctly
- [ ] Test failed payment scenarios
- [ ] Confirm booking confirmations sent via email

### 2. Error Monitoring
Consider adding error tracking:
```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
# Configure Sentry for production error tracking
```

### 3. Logging
- [ ] Set up structured logging (e.g., Winston, Pino)
- [ ] Configure log aggregation (e.g., Logtail, Papertrail)
- [ ] Add monitoring for webhook failures

### 4. Performance
- [ ] Enable Next.js production optimizations
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Test site performance with Lighthouse
- [ ] Optimize images (already using Next.js Image)

### 5. Backup Strategy
- [ ] Configure Supabase automatic backups
- [ ] Document database restore procedure
- [ ] Test backup restoration process

## üîç Testing Checklist

### User Flows
- [ ] **Registration**:
  - Provider registration creates account + default business hours
  - Customer registration works
  - Email validation works
  - Rate limiting prevents spam

- [ ] **Login**:
  - Email/password login works
  - JWT token generated correctly
  - Token expires after 7 days
  - Rate limiting prevents brute force

- [ ] **Service Management**:
  - Create service with capacity settings
  - Edit service
  - Toggle active/inactive
  - Delete service (only if no bookings)
  - Copy booking link works

- [ ] **Staff Management**:
  - Add staff member
  - Edit staff details
  - Toggle active/inactive
  - Delete staff (only if no active bookings)
  - Staff member counts show correctly

- [ ] **Booking Flow**:
  - Customer selects service
  - Calendar shows correct availability
  - Customer fills booking form
  - Payment processed (Stripe/Vipps/Cash)
  - Confirmation email sent with staff name
  - Booking appears in provider dashboard

- [ ] **Business Hours**:
  - Default hours created on registration
  - Edit business hours
  - Close specific days
  - Availability respects business hours

- [ ] **Calendar**:
  - Shows all bookings
  - Color-coded by status
  - Staff name displayed
  - Can filter by status

### Security Testing
- [ ] Cannot access other provider's data
- [ ] Cannot modify bookings without auth
- [ ] Rate limiting triggers correctly
- [ ] Webhook signature verification works
- [ ] CORS only allows configured origins
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (Prisma handles this)
- [ ] XSS prevention (React handles this)

---

## üìä Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current State
‚úÖ **Fully Functional**:
- Multi-staff scheduling with auto-assignment
- Capacity management (max concurrent bookings)
- Payment processing (Stripe confirmed, Vipps needs webhook)
- Email notifications with staff names
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Security headers and CORS
- Webhook payment confirmations

### Missing Features (Not Critical for Launch)
1. **Google Calendar Integration** - User requested but not implemented
2. **Google OAuth Login** - User requested but not implemented
3. **Vipps Webhook Handler** - Similar to Stripe, needs webhook endpoint
4. **Redis-based Rate Limiting** - Current uses in-memory (works for single instance)
5. **SMS Notifications** - Twilio configured but not implemented
6. **Staff Assignment UI** - Can assign "any staff" but not specific staff members
7. **24-Hour Reminder Emails** - Function exists but not scheduled (needs cron job)

### Recommended Additions Before Scale
1. **Redis** for rate limiting and session management
2. **Monitoring** (Sentry, DataDog, or similar)
3. **Analytics** (PostHog, Mixpanel)
4. **Load balancer** if expecting high traffic
5. **CDN** (Vercel Edge, Cloudflare)
