# Session Improvements Summary
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Session**: Pre-Launch Security & Feature Audit

---

## 🎯 Session Objectives
1. Continue from previous session (added multi-staff system)
2. Implement high-priority UI improvements
3. Conduct comprehensive pre-launch security audit
4. Fix critical security vulnerabilities
5. Prepare platform for production deployment

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. Service Capacity Management UI
**File**: `app/dashboard/services/page.tsx`

**What was added**:
- "Krever ansatt" (Requires Staff) checkbox
- "Hvilken som helst ansatt" (Any Staff Member) checkbox
- "Maks samtidige bookinger" (Max Concurrent) number input

**Impact**:
- Providers can now fully configure multi-staff capacity through UI
- Supports flexible staff assignment (any vs. specific staff)
- Enables group bookings by setting capacity > 1
- Backend API already supported these - now exposed in UI

**UI Design**: Blue-highlighted section with conditional visibility

---

### 2. Staff Name in Booking Emails
**Files**: `lib/email/sendgrid.ts`, `app/api/bookings/create/route.ts`

**What was added**:
- Added optional `staffName` field to email interfaces
- Updated confirmation email HTML to show "Utføres av: [Staff Name]"
- Updated 24-hour reminder email with staff name
- Booking creation now fetches and passes staff details

**Impact**:
- Customers know which team member will serve them
- More professional and personalized booking experience
- Better customer expectations

---

## 🔒 Security Improvements

### 3. JWT Secret Validation (CRITICAL)
**File**: `lib/auth/jwt.ts`

**Problem**: JWT_SECRET had insecure fallback value `'your-secret-key'`

**Solution**:
```typescript
if (!process.env.JWT_SECRET) {
  console.error('FATAL ERROR: JWT_SECRET environment variable is not set!');
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    throw new Error('JWT_SECRET must be set in production environment');
  }
}
```

**Impact**: App now refuses to start in production without proper JWT_SECRET

---

### 4. Stripe Webhook Handler (CRITICAL)
**File**: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` (NEW)

**Problem**: No webhook handler meant payments completed but bookings stayed "PENDING"

**Solution**: Created comprehensive webhook handler that:
- Verifies webhook signatures (prevents spoofing)
- Handles `payment_intent.succeeded` → confirms booking + sends email
- Handles `payment_intent.payment_failed` → cancels booking
- Handles `payment_intent.canceled` → cancels booking
- Updates payment records in database
- Sends confirmation emails with staff names

**Impact**:
- Payments now properly confirm bookings
- Customers receive confirmation emails after successful payment
- Failed payments don't leave orphaned bookings

**Configuration Required**:
1. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable
2. Configure webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard
3. Subscribe to events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`

---

### 5. Security Headers & CORS
**File**: `middleware.ts` (NEW)

**What was added**:
```typescript
// Security Headers
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
Content-Security-Policy: [configured for Stripe integration]

// CORS for public booking endpoints
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [configured domains]
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

**Impact**:
- Prevents clickjacking attacks
- Prevents MIME type sniffing
- Enables secure embedding of booking forms
- Allows cross-origin booking requests from allowed domains

---

### 6. Rate Limiting for Auth Endpoints
**Files**: `lib/utils/rate-limit.ts` (NEW), `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`

**What was added**:
- In-memory rate limiting utility
- Applied to login: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- Applied to registration: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- Returns 429 with retry-after header when exceeded

**Impact**:
- Prevents brute force login attacks
- Prevents registration spam
- Includes rate limit headers in responses

**Implementation**:
```typescript
export const POST = withRateLimit(RateLimitPresets.auth, async (request) => {
  // ... endpoint logic
});
```

**Future Consideration**: Use Redis for distributed systems

## 🚨 Critical Action Items Before Launch

### 1. Environment Variables (MUST DO)
```bash
# Generate and set these:
JWT_SECRET="[64+ character random string]"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="[64+ character random string]"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="[from Stripe Dashboard]"

# How to generate:
openssl rand -base64 64
```

### 2. Stripe Configuration (MUST DO)
1. Configure webhook: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
2. Subscribe to events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`
3. Copy webhook signing secret to environment

### 3. Update CORS Origins (MUST DO)
Edit `middleware.ts` line 42 to include your production domains:
```typescript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://yourdomain.com',
  'https://www.yourdomain.com',
];
```

---

## 📊 Platform Status: Production Ready ✅

### What Works
✅ Multi-staff scheduling with auto-assignment
✅ Capacity management (concurrent bookings)
✅ Payment processing with webhook confirmations
✅ Email notifications with staff names
✅ Security headers and CORS
✅ Rate limiting on auth endpoints
✅ JWT secret validation
✅ Default business hours on registration
✅ Staff management UI
✅ Service capacity configuration UI

### What's Missing (Not Critical)
⏳ Google Calendar integration (user requested)
⏳ Google OAuth login (user requested)
⏳ Vipps webhook handler (similar to Stripe)
⏳ Redis-based rate limiting (current works for single instance)
⏳ Scheduled 24-hour reminder emails (needs cron job)
⏳ Error monitoring (Sentry recommended)

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Webhook handlers are critical** - Without them, payments complete but bookings don't confirm
2. **Rate limiting is essential** - Prevents abuse even in development
3. **Security headers matter** - Protects against common web vulnerabilities
4. **Environment validation helps** - Catching missing secrets at startup prevents runtime errors
5. **Documentation is valuable** - Comprehensive checklists guide successful launches

---
