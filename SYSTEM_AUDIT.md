## Critical Issues Found

### 1. BROKEN: No Business Hours by Default
- New providers have NO business hours set
- Calendar shows ALL days as unavailable
- **Fix Needed**: Create default business hours on registration

### 2. BROKEN: Services Can't Set Staff Capacity
- UI doesn't expose `requiresStaff`, `anyStaffMember`, `maxConcurrent`
- Providers can't configure the multi-staff system we built!
- **Fix Needed**: Add capacity fields to service form

### 3. UX: Full Page Refreshes
- Every navigation reloads the entire page
- Slow and jarring
- **Fix Needed**: Replace `<a>` with Next.js `<Link>`

### 4. MISSING: Service Needs Business Hours Check
- Can create service before setting business hours
- Results in zero availability
- **Fix Needed**: Warn if no business hours set

### 5. MISSING: Staff Assignment to Services
- No way to assign specific staff to services
- `anyStaffMember=false` is useless
- **Fix Needed**: Staff assignment UI

### 6. UX: No Onboarding Flow
- New users are confused
- Don't know what to do first
- **Fix Needed**: Setup wizard

### 7. MISSING: Booking Confirmation Shows No Staff
- Emails don't show which staff member
- **Fix Needed**: Include staff name in confirmations

### 8. PERFORMANCE: Availability Prefetch is Slow
- 30 parallel API calls on calendar load
- **Fix Needed**: Batch into single endpoint
