## ⚙️ Configuration Required:

To enable email and payments, you need to set up these services:

### 1. SendGrid (Email Notifications)
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Your Business Name
```

### 2. Stripe (Credit Card Payments)
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 3. Vipps (Norwegian Mobile Payments)
```bash
VIPPS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
VIPPS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
VIPPS_MERCHANT_SERIAL_NUMBER=your_msn
VIPPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your_key
```

All these are OPTIONAL - the platform works perfectly without them!
- Without SendGrid: No email confirmations (but booking still works)
- Without Stripe/Vipps: Use "CASH" payment method
