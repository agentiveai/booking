## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
/public/widget.js                          → Embeddable script (client-side)
  └─ Creates iframe                        → Points to /embed/[userId]
  └─ Manages modal overlay                 → For popup/floating types
  └─ Handles postMessage                   → Communication with iframe

/app/embed/[userId]/page.tsx               → Iframe content (server-side)
  └─ Fetches provider data                 → From /api/public/provider/[username]
  └─ Applies branding                      → Logo + colors
  └─ Renders service list                  → With book buttons
  └─ Handles navigation                    → Opens booking page

/app/dashboard/embedding/page.tsx          → Dashboard UI (client-side)
  └─ Displays provider ID                  → From auth context
  └─ Generates embed codes                 → For all three types
  └─ Copy-to-clipboard                     → Navigator API
  └─ Live preview                          → Iframe of /embed/[userId]
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Provider adds <script> to their website
2. widget.js loads and executes
3. Detects widget type from data attributes
4. Creates iframe pointing to /embed/[userId]
5. Embed page fetches provider + services from API
6. Applies custom branding (colors, logo)
7. Renders services with book buttons
8. User clicks "Book" → postMessage to parent
9. Opens booking page in new window
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/public/provider/[username]` - Returns provider + services with branding
- Existing booking page APIs (unchanged)

### Security & CORS
- `/widget.js` is a public static file (no auth required)
- `/embed/[userId]` is a public page (no auth required)
- `/api/public/provider/[username]` is a public API (already existed)
- Works across any domain (CORS-friendly)
- No sensitive data exposed in iframe

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before going to production:

### 1. Update Widget Script URL
In `/public/widget.js`, update line 23:
```javascript
// Current (development)
const WIDGET_BASE_URL = window.location.origin;

// For production
const WIDGET_BASE_URL = 'https://yourdomain.com';
```

### 2. Test on Production Domain
- Upload test HTML file to external website
- Verify widget loads from your production domain
- Test all three widget types
- Verify branding displays correctly
- Check mobile responsiveness

### 3. Update Documentation
- Replace all `http://localhost:3000` references with production URL
- Update provider IDs in examples to real provider IDs
- Create video tutorial for clients (optional)

### 4. Provider Communication
Send announcement to existing providers:
- "New Feature: Embed Your Booking Page Anywhere!"
- Link to Dashboard → Embedding page
- Quick start guide
- Video demo (optional)
- Link to support documentation
