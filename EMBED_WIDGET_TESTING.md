# Embed Widget Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to test all three embed widget types that were implemented in Phase 2.

## Prerequisites

1. Your Next.js development server must be running: `npm run dev`
2. You need a provider user ID from your database
3. The provider should have at least one active service configured

## Test Files Created

- `/public/widget.js` - The embeddable JavaScript widget (330 lines)
- `/app/embed/[userId]/page.tsx` - The embed page with branding support
- `/public/embed-test.html` - Comprehensive test page for all three widget types

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Provider ID

1. Log into your dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Navigate to Dashboard ‚Üí Embedding (`/dashboard/embedding`)
3. Your provider ID will be displayed at the top of the page
4. Copy this ID (it looks like `cm2abc123xyz`)

### Step 2: Update Test Page

Open `/public/embed-test.html` and replace all instances of `USER_ID_PLACEHOLDER` with your actual provider ID:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<div id="booking-widget" data-provider-id="USER_ID_PLACEHOLDER"></div>

<!-- After -->
<div id="booking-widget" data-provider-id="cm2abc123xyz"></div>
```

Find and replace in 3 locations:
- Line ~105: Inline embed demo
- Line ~143: Popup button demo
- Line ~223: Floating button script

### Step 3: Access Test Page

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/embed-test.html
```

## Widget Types to Test

### 1. Inline Embed Widget ‚úÖ

**What to test:**
- Widget appears directly embedded in the page
- Shows provider logo/initial with custom brand colors
- Lists all active services
- Service cards show correct pricing and duration
- Hover effects work (border color changes to brand color)
- Clicking "Book" opens booking page in new window or navigates in same window

**Expected behavior:**
- Clean, responsive layout
- Custom brand colors applied throughout
- Conditional "Powered by" footer (hidden if provider has Pro plan with `hideBranding: true`)

### 2. Popup Button Widget ‚úÖ

**What to test:**
- Click the "Book Your Appointment" button
- Modal overlay appears with blur effect
- Close button (√ó) appears in top-right
- Widget displays inside modal
- Clicking outside modal closes it
- Close button works
- Body scroll is disabled when modal is open

**Expected behavior:**
- Smooth fade-in animation
- Overlay has blur effect
- Modal is centered and responsive
- Can close by clicking overlay or close button

### 3. Floating Button Widget ‚úÖ

**What to test:**
- Floating button appears at bottom-right (or configured position)
- Button shows calendar icon and custom text ("Book")
- Button color matches configuration (#667eea in test page)
- Hover effect: button lifts up and shadow increases
- Clicking opens popup modal (same as Type 2)

**Expected behavior:**
- Button stays fixed while scrolling
- Smooth hover animations
- Opens same modal as popup button
- Position can be configured (bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, top-left)

## Customization Options to Test

### Floating Button Customizations

Edit the script tag at the bottom of `embed-test.html`:

```html
<script src="/widget.js"
        data-provider-id="YOUR_ID"
        data-float="true"
        data-button-text="Book Now"          <!-- Change button text -->
        data-button-color="#FF5733"          <!-- Change button color -->
        data-position="bottom-left">         <!-- Change position -->
</script>
```

Test each option:
- ‚úÖ `data-button-text`: Change text (e.g., "Schedule", "Reserve", "Bestill Time")
- ‚úÖ `data-button-color`: Try different colors (#0066FF, #10b981, #ef4444)
- ‚úÖ `data-position`: Try all positions (bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, top-left)

## Branding Features to Test

### Custom Logo
1. Upload a logo via Dashboard ‚Üí Branding
2. Reload test page
3. Verify logo appears in:
   - Inline embed header
   - Popup modal header
   - Embed page header

### Custom Brand Colors
1. Set custom colors via Dashboard ‚Üí Branding (e.g., #FF5733)
2. Reload test page
3. Verify colors applied to:
   - Service card borders on hover
   - Price text
   - Book buttons (background)
   - Book buttons on hover (dark variant)
   - Loading spinners
   - Icons

### Hide Branding (Pro Feature)
1. Upgrade to Pro plan (or set plan in database manually)
2. Enable "Hide Platform Branding" in Dashboard ‚Üí Branding
3. Reload test page
4. Verify "Powered by Booking Platform" footer is removed

## Browser DevTools Testing

### PostMessage Communication

Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab and look for:

```javascript
// When iframe loads
{ type: 'BOOKING_WIDGET_RESIZE', height: 600 }

// When user clicks "Book" in widget
{ type: 'BOOKING_WIDGET_NAVIGATE', url: '/booking/cm2abc123xyz?serviceId=...' }
```

### Network Tab

Check that resources load correctly:
- ‚úÖ `/widget.js` (200 OK)
- ‚úÖ `/embed/YOUR_ID` (200 OK)
- ‚úÖ `/api/public/provider/YOUR_ID` (200 OK, returns provider + services)
- ‚úÖ Logo image if uploaded (200 OK)

### Responsive Testing

Test on different screen sizes:
1. Desktop (1920x1080) - All widgets work
2. Tablet (768x1024) - Layout adjusts
3. Mobile (375x667) - Floating button remains visible, modal is full-screen

Use DevTools Device Toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M / Cmd+Shift+M)

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Widget doesn't appear

**Fix:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify provider ID is correct
- Ensure development server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check `/api/public/provider/YOUR_ID` returns data

### Issue: Colors not applying

**Fix:**
- Check provider has `brandColor` and `brandColorDark` set in database
- Default values are `#0066FF` and `#0052CC`
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Logo not showing

**Fix:**
- Verify logo was uploaded successfully via Dashboard ‚Üí Branding
- Check logo path in database (`/uploads/logos/...`)
- Ensure file exists in `/public/uploads/logos/` directory
- Check browser console for 404 errors

### Issue: Modal won't close

**Fix:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure close button event listeners are attached
- Try clicking outside modal area (not on modal itself)

### Issue: Floating button doesn't appear

**Fix:**
- Verify script has `data-float="true"` attribute
- Check `data-provider-id` is set correctly
- Look for button at configured position (default: bottom-right)
- Check z-index conflicts with other page elements (widget uses z-index: 999998)

## Testing on External Website

To test widgets on a real external website:

### 1. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Build and deploy your Next.js app
npm run build
npm start

# Or deploy to Vercel/Netlify/etc
```

### 2. Create Test HTML File

Create `test.html` on your external website:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="no">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Widget Test</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p>Welcome! Book an appointment below:</p>

  <!-- Inline Widget -->
  <div id="booking-widget" data-provider-id="YOUR_ID"></div>
  <script src="https://yourdomain.com/widget.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Test CORS

Ensure your Next.js API allows cross-origin requests if needed. The widget should work across domains because:
- `/widget.js` is a public static file
- `/embed/[userId]` page is public (no auth required)
- `/api/public/provider/[username]` is a public API

## Success Criteria

All three widget types are working correctly if:

‚úÖ **Inline Embed:**
- Displays services in embedded container
- Custom branding (logo + colors) applied
- Clicking "Book" opens booking page
- Responsive on mobile/tablet

‚úÖ **Popup Button:**
- Button triggers modal overlay
- Modal shows booking widget
- Close button and overlay click both close modal
- Smooth animations (fade-in, slide-up)

‚úÖ **Floating Button:**
- Button appears at configured position
- Stays visible while scrolling
- Hover effects work smoothly
- Opens same modal as popup button
- Customization options work (text, color, position)

‚úÖ **Branding:**
- Custom logo displays correctly
- Brand colors applied throughout
- "Powered by" footer respects `hideBranding` setting
- Dark color variant used on hover states

## Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:

1. ‚úÖ Mark Phase 2 as complete
2. üìù Document any issues found
3. üöÄ Consider starting Phase 3: Workflows & Automations
4. üìä Gather feedback from real providers using the embed widgets
5. üé® Consider additional customization options based on user requests

## Demo for Clients

When showing embed widgets to potential clients:

1. Show the Dashboard ‚Üí Embedding page with copy-paste code
2. Demonstrate live preview of inline embed
3. Show customization options (colors, logo)
4. Walk through adding widget to a sample HTML page
5. Highlight ease of use compared to Calendly/Cal.com
